My Scratch project is a game called Dodge the Meteorites. The objective is to survive for as long as possible while avoiding meteorites that fall from the sky. To play, simply use your mouse to control the spaceship, moving it left and right to dodge the falling objects. A score variable in the top-left corner keeps track of your survival time, increasing every second you stay in the game. The game ends immediately if your spaceship is hit by a meteorite. The meteorites will appear at random horizontal positions, making each playthrough a unique challenge.
